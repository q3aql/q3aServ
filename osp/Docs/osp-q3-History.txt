       be included in the list). (thanks arqy :) )

       teamchatted, all of his non customloc-using buddies would see just
       numbers for his position. Its all better now, got it?  Customloc is

			     of color1 for teammates, and the R parameter

- Add: Dynamic map lists!  With Quake 1.27n or higher, OSP now has
  the capability of auto-generating map lists on the fly, based on
  current game type. The OSP map lists are still useful for forcing
  maps to be available in the case where the auto-generation of the
  map list misses a particular map (i.e. a map's .arena file doesn't
  specify the current active g_gametype).  There is also a new map
  entry type:

	deletemap <mapname>

  To *remove* maps that are auto-added but are not desired by the
  server admin.  To enable this auto-generation of map lists, use
  the following variable:

	map_autoload <0|1> (default = 1 - ON)

  Note: OSP will regenerate these map lists on map load and map
        restarts, so for remote administration, all one has to
        do is upload the map .pk3 file to the baseq3/ directory,
        and OSP will automatically pick it up and add it to the
        maplist (if the .arena for the map specifies the map is
        intended for the current gametype). OSP will also weed
        out maps that are specified, but are not located on the
        server (i.e. mapname typos in the map config file).

- Fix: lock/unlock are no longer toggle commands.
- Fix: Font shadows for q3comp scoreboard.
- Fix: Coaches going to free-float spec if the person they are
  chasing disconnects from the game.
- Fix: Various statusbar fixes for several statusbars.
- Fix: Occasional multiview bug that will crash Quake3.
- Fix: Reward decal placement.
- Fix: Score updates when match is in overtime.
- Fix: Badlands warmup mode now starts with 100 bullets.
- Fix: No suicides allowed during a timeout.

- Fix: Compatibility with CPM client "color" format.
- Change: Grapple is now similar to a white rail trail.
- Add: Time/date stamp to intermission scoreboard.
- Add: More anti-cheat measures (read: nopbot thwarting).  This
  slightly modifies the server_ospauth variable.  Its settings
  are now:
	0 - No security
	1 - Enhanced nopbot protection + authentication
	2 (or higher) - Authentication only

- Add: The OSP client now has the ability to automatically
  perform actions at certain points in the game.  The client
  variable is:

     cg_autoAction <option_bitmask> (default = 0)

       <option_bitmask>:
             1 - Automatically save stats to a local text
                 file at the end of a match. Logs will be
                 stored in:

                   <osp_root>/stats/<date>/<logname>.txt

             2 - Automatically take an end-level screenshot
             4 - Automatically record a match (requires
                 a full warmup server - g_warmup = 0)

- Add: More cg_nomip options.  The values are additive:
	  1 - Lightning Gun
	  2 - Plasma Gun
	  4 - Rocket Launcher
	  8 - Grenade Launcher
	 16 - Bullets
	 32 - Railgun

  Note: If you use marks, the marks for each weapon are
        also set to picmip level 0.

  to a log (name as described for the cg_statsdump variable,
  listed above).     
- Add: Upcoming 1.27l cgame changes.
- Add: Lag reduction for clients on servers running Quake3
  version 1.27l or greater.
- Add: Stat for total time of flag carried in CTF.  OSP also
  now reports how long a carrier had the flag when they die
  or make a cap (good for timing different carrier routes).
- Add: Flag carriers have highest precidence in follow_powerup
  settings.  Once u are on a flag carrier, you will not switch
  automatically unless they are killed or cap the flag.
- Add: In follow_powerup mode, if the current powerup player
  is killed, you will switch to another powerup carrier, if
  one exists (rather than switching to the killer).
- Add: Clientside logging option.  Set cg_clientLog X (where
  "X" is 1 or higher) to enable logging of messages issued
  during gameplay.  Time-stamps included!  All entries
  appended to osp/client_logs/clientX.txt
- Add: Customizable, per-map, server-side decal graphics
  placement within a map.  Servers can define up to 32 unique
  decals for each map.  For more info, check out:

    Docs/osp-q3-Decal-Editing.txt

  This is a handy feature for server-branding, tournaments, etc.
  A full in-game editor for decal placement is also available!
  Note: Only spectators will see these decals.  Players will
  NOT be affected by these customizations (shown in warmup,
  NOT shown during the match).

Feb 20: 0.99s1
==============
- Fix: Jumppad sounds.  Still not perfect, but more consistant.
- Fix: Suicide stats cleared properly.
- Fix: Random double loads on startup.

  work for custom configs as well.
- Fix: Spec couldnt see server settings with \callvote [option]
- Fix: Map reloads in 1v1
- Fix: Buffered announcements playing at wrong times
- Change: pmove_fixed 1 is now default again.
- Add: Q3Comp scoreboard courtest of ]R[Papa.  Option:
        cg_q3compscoreboard [0|1] (default = 0)

        cg_nomip [flags]
          lightning shaft - 1
              plasma bolt - 2

  --> Its a bitmask, so 3 will picmip both lg and pg

- Add: \credits command.  Check it out!!!
- Add: \callvote badlands for tp.net Badlands TDM settings.
  Works just like settdm, setctf, etc. in terms of usage.  Note:
  this mode utilizes a custom map queue that contains maps not in
  the default id map list.  Do NOT enable this mode for voting unless
  you have all of the maps.  For a list of maps and where to get them,
  visit: http://badlands.teamplay.net.  OSP 1.0 will ship with these
  maps (in addition to others -- send me a list of maps you want to see!).
  If you want to start a server in badlands mode, use mode_start 2.  This
  gametype has replaced the "FFA Competition" mode in previous releases.
- Add: Windowed stats option.  To view current stats while playing
  or following a player, bind a key to +wstats.  A sliding window
  will pop out showing your current game stats.  This will also
  show at intermission below the scoreboard for complete match
  summary on a single screen.  In multiview, the stats of the player
  of the highlighted window will be displayed.
- Add: cg_statscrolltime to control the time for the stats window
  to slide out and back in (default = 0.15s = 150ms).  Setting
  this to 0 will result in the stats window appearing and disappearing
  immediately.
- Add: Q3Comp Status bars (ch_StatusbarFormat 9-12)
- Add: Q3Comp Scoreboard (cg_q3compScoreboard 1)
- Add: Q3Comp -/+ actions (see client readme)
- Add: flag carrier's names to the hud (cg_drawFlagNames 0-4)

- Change: server_customclient no longer reset by internal configs.
- Fix: Default configs had ".cfg" extension instead of ".txt"

- Add: Real time/date stamps for demos/screenshots
- Add: Real time/date stamps in admin log
- Add: Gauntlet enable/disable feature.  Its added in the

  used instead.
- Add: Option for custom server-specified graphics.  Check out
  the osp-q3-server-gfx.txt for complete details.
- Add: New mode server specification/voting format. Check out

Dec 29: 0.99q
=============
- Fix: More issues with mode switching

- Fix: QTV/GTV clients dont automatically receive record commands
  if the server has them enabled.
- Fix: Pickup sounds now under cg_predictitems 0 now sound identical

  cg_predictitmes 1 anymore :)
- Fix: Vote/ref client kicking now works properly.
- Tweak: Various colors and message format changes in several areas.
- Change: New format for client authentication.
- Add: Can now drop items (in addition to flags) in CTF, if the
  option is enabled.

- Add: CPM hud is now available under non-CPM modes. This pushes
  the number of status bar formats up to 8 or 9, and the number of
  weapon status layouts to 6.
- Add: Weapon status bar and CPM status bars have been added to the
  \menu command under HUD options.  Very easy now to properly set up
  your personalized HUD.
- Add: Server-side MOTD messages.  Server ops can specify up to 8
  lines of 64-character per line text.  Server vars (for each line)
  are:
        server_motd1
        server_motd2
        server_motd3
        server_motd4
        server_motd5
        server_motd6
        server_motd7
        server_motd8
  ---> The first NULL ("") var encountered marks the end of the
       MOTD message displayed for clients.
- Add: \motd client command to re-view server's MOTD.

Dec 18: 0.99p
=============
- Fix: pmove_fixed, pmove_msec, and g_smoothClients can now be set
  properly by the server.
- Fix: Can now utilize OSP-enhanced client features during demo
  playback.
- Add: "pmove" is now enforced by the server, but can be voted
  on/off by clients (new server var: vote_allow_pmove defaults
  to 1).
- Fix: Fire button handling if in chase while speclocked from the
  other team now does nothing.
- Fix: vq3 compatibility (i.e. for demo playback w/o OSP client,
  and baseq3 server spoofing).
- Update: All server configs now set with proper defaults.

Dec 16: 0.99o1
==============
- Fix: Flag pickups were crashing the client.

Dec 16: 0.99o (0.99"o"lzah)
===========================
- Upgrade: Ported OSP to Quake3 point release 1.27.  Most every
  feature in 1.27 baseq3 is now also in OSP.  This port has a couple
  of notes:
      - Splash-through-floors is still an option in OSP.  However,
        I've set the default to OFF to maintain consistancy with
        id's current baseq3 model.
      - Head models are NOT supported
      - Only base3 is support, no TA support yet (no source!)
      - Left most OSP sound code in as it works better :)
      - menu commands for cgame are temporarily disabled (bug)
      - disable_<weaponname> option not included (OSP's is more
        flexible).
      - Variables are getting reset due to improper loading of
        q3config.cfg (quake3.exe problem).  This should really
        only affect listen servers presently.
      - Removed 125Hz support as 1.27 supports its own version
        of this option.
      - This version will NOT work with any Quake3 version prior
        to 1.27.
      - I've kept the 1.17-compatible source around in case the
        need arises to create an updated version of OSP for this
        version of Quake3.  Just FYI :)

** SERVER OPERATORS: **
  Delete ALL cgame.pk3 files in your osp/ directory!! Old versions
  of the cgame will NOT work with this version of OSP.  Dedicated
  servers should only have the current cgame.pk3 in the osp/
  directory anyway, but this is an additional warning :) REMEMBER
  TO KEEP THE Z-OSP-EXTRAXXX.PK3 -- DO *NOT* DELETE IT!!!  Also,
  be sure to remove ALL files in the osp/paks/ directory.
***********************

- Add: Kill/death weapon stats
- Add: Gauntlet stats
- Fix: team_maxplayers and team locking fixed for CA
- Change: team_weaponrespawn variable to g_weaponTeamRespawn (for
  vanilla quake3 compatibility).
- Fix: Backpack pickup problems for CPM
- Fix: CPM fire rate for GL changed to CPM 1.0 setting of 700
- Fix: Ref "ban" command can now be used (again)
- Fix: Mode voting more streamlined

Dec 05: 0.99n
=============
- Fix: Lag from networking overhead.  A lot of this is due to server-
  info variables.  I've paired down what OSP puts out, but server
  admins also need to limit the size and number of sets variables
  they add to their configs.  If your server seems laggy, try to
  eliminate all serverinfo vars.
- Add: \callvote facility has been seriously revamped.  Every votable
  option now has a usage, description, and current setting listing
  assigned to it.  Just type: \callvote ? and \callvote <command> ?
  to see all the juicy details.
- Add: Overtime voting.  \callvote overtime for its options :)
- Clarification: cg_enemyModel and cg_swapSkins were functional in the
  0.99m release.
- Add: vote_allow_overtime for enable/disable of overtime voting.
- Fix: server_maxpacketsmax wouldn't get reset if it was changed
  through vote.
- Fix: .loc support.  The main fix is that clients need to use .cfg
  files rather than .loc files.  This is to allow clients to read
  location files while connected to pure servers.  Location files
  still need to live in osp/locs/, with <map_name>.cfg naming
  convention. Location text markers are cool!  Make em with color!
  64 per map!
- Fix: Switch from multiview to viewcam was broken.
- Fix: g_forcerespawn times are now correct.
- Add: \followprev and \follownext while folling individual players
  under viewcam allows easy switching between players.
- Add: TeamDmg: <x> log entry for teamplay-based games
- Add: More viewcam files!! Thanks to Gouki for rounding out the ctf
  viewcam definition files, and thanks to Olzah for ztn3dm1.
- Add: cg_followviewcam: sets the default action of the viewcam, when
  it is used by the client (client cvar).

	cg_followviewcam 0 - Sets viewcam in dynamic mode, following
                             where most of the action is located.
                         1 - Sets viewcam to follow only a single
                             player (default).
- Add: cg_followkiller: Auto-switches to killer of chases player.
  (client cvar)

	cg_followkiller 0 - Do NOT auto switch (default)
                        1 - Switch to killer, if havent switched
                            recently.
  ---> This option while following a player is great for 1v1 matches.
       Using this option while viewcamming a team game is quite nice
       as well.
- Add: A lot of consistancy has been added when switching spec modes.
  For instance, if you have cg_followviewcam 1 and are in-eyes chasing
  a player, issuing a \viewcam command will automatically switch to
  viewcam follow of the player you were just chasing.  Conversely,
  if you type the \follow command when chasing a player with the viewcam,
  you will automatically switch to the in-eyes view of a player that
  you were just following with the viewcam.  This allows for easy
  viewing transitions with simple binds and not needing to pull up
  player info to switch spec modes on a particular player.
- Change: Some clean up of the \players command to view connecting
  players (i.e. for kicking purposes).
- Add: cg_fov is now used for panels in multiview
- Add: How to get started under OSP document from Fiafiaga.  Thanks man!
- Add: Ability to rotate through members of the same team in a
  multiview pane:
       \viewcyclenext
       \viewcycleprev
  (works also in FFA/1v1 mode, but cycles through the players)
- Update: Updated spectool.cfg to include viewcycleprev/next cmds.

Nov 12: 0.99m
=============
- Fix: QTV/GTV authentication problems.
- Fix: Some cvars not resetting properly when going from promode->vq3.
- Fix: Another exploit on callvote command.
- Fix: Lag spikes on client connects.
- Add: Time remaining info on \scores command.
- Add: \coachkick command to remove a coach on your team.
- Add: Team damage stat for TDM game scores (noted as TD).
- Change: ch_crosshaircolor is the default variable for changing
  crosshair in all modes of play (cg_hud_crosshaircolor is no longer
  used).
- Fix: Suicide kick/ban error.
- Change: Client info streamlined for better network performance
- Fix: If in thirdperson while in teamplay, player's team symbol
  doesnt appear above head (easier to see).
- Fix: Update ctf.cfg and ctfmaps.txt files.  PLEASE UPGRADE TO
  THESE AS REFERENCE!!!!
- Fix: The +modif(1-5) commands didnt work properly.  +/- commands
  should again work.
- Add: Optimizations on client cgame for better framerates.  Will
  work on server optimizations next.  I vow to introduce optimiza-
  tions up until 1.0 :)
- Add: Admin logging information on banned/illegal player connects
  (stuff that will be logged to admin_log file, if enabled).
- Add: New spectool.cfg config
- Add: Totally redesigned help system.  \help now just lists available
  game commands.  Descriptions of commands can now be found by:
        \command_name ?
- Add: ? as a command for easy help info.
- Update: Updated rail-only ctf and teamplay .cfgs
- Add: Logging-OSP.txt to OSP/Docs directory.  Several people from
  the community have asked about some of OSP's extended logging
  format, so this should help budding log parser programmers who
  are interested in adding OSP-enhanced logging support.  If you
  add OSP-enhanced logging to your parser, let me know and I will
  pimp your parser in OSP! :)

Oct 24: 0.99l
=============
- Fix: QTV/GTV connect support
- Change: Voting for QTV/GTV is now simple, just:
	\callvote qtv  (or gtv)
  To automatically call a vote to allow these clients to connect to
  a pure server.
- Change: Default vote_allow_machinegun 0 and match_matchsuicides 0

Oct 24: 0.99k
=============
- Fix: Chat for coaches
- Fix: r_allready and console-based allready commands now work as
  expected.
- Tweaks: team.cfg, ctf.cfg, 1v1.cfg, clanarena.cfg configs.  Please
  update your configs with these as reference!

Oct 22: 0.99j
=============
- Change: Server configs.  Server operators, PLEASE update to the
  provided configs settings (team.cfg, ctf.cfg, 1v1.cfg, clanarena.cfg)
  and osp/modes-cfg/compmodes.cfg.  All of these files have been updated
  to facilitate better online match play.  The ctf.cfg has been signi-
  ficantly changed such that the original ctf.cfg has been replaced
  with OGL-style match settings.  It's previous settings have been
  preserved in ctf-public.cfg.  *Please* migrate all configs to these
  settings.. thanks!
- Fix: Sometimes a player's name doesn't show up when being followed.
- Fix: Would try to rotate to the viewcam, even if it wasnt enabled.
- Fix: g_forcerespawn settings wouldn't survive across map loads.
- Fix: No lagometer in vq3
- Add: Allow transparency of scoreboard: cg_scoretransparency (default
  = 1.0 -- no transparency).  This setting just adjusts the alpha
  channel of the font on the scoreboard.  The lower, the more
  transparent the scores will be.
- Add: Configurable # of suicides before a client is kicked (default
  = 5).  A client will be kick/banned for a map that /kill themselves
  the set # of times, or suicide (lava jumping) 2*setting.  New var:
	match_maxsuicides <value>
- Change: If ch_crosshaircolor is set to 0, then the crosshairs
  provided with baseq3 will be used to allow better scaling (though
  you can only have the color of the crosshair set to white).
- Change: "\callvote ref" without specifying a player will put your-
  self up for referee vote.
- Add: Show a player's score in multi-view.  If TDM, the team score
  is also shown.
- Add: Color overlay of a player's team in multiview.
- Fix: Box scores in 1v1 if spectating.
- Add: Allow the \players command to be issued as a console/rcon
  command.
- Fix: Lagometer doesnt show up if OSP hud is enabled.
- Fix: Ammo pickup even if full in CPM mode.
- Add: Bit for enable/disable OSP hud from the server.  Current
  settings for server_customclient are now:
       server_customclient <flags> (default = 8, only OSP-HUD)
           <flags>:
                  1 - Enable 125Hz sampling.
                  2 - Allow cg_truelightning usage.
                  4 - Custom graphics used with cg_altPlasma and
                      cg_altLightning is allowed.
			8 - Toggles client usage of OSP-based HUD.
       ---> This is also votable with vote_allow_osphud setting.
- Fix: Another vote loophole.
- Fix: Problems with "\callvote mapnext".
- Add: Allow GTV to work like QTV in OSP servers.
- Add: Allow QTV/GTV to use multiview, if desired.
- Add: Allow specifying machinegun damage.  Can also vote for mg
  respwan ammo and damge:
	mg_damage (default = 7) -- For non-Team DM
	mg_damageTeamplay (default = 5) -- For Team DM
	vote_allow_machinegun (default = 1 - enabled)
- Add: Force-model/skins (thanks a bunch arQon!) for clients:
	cg_enemyModel <modelname> (default = "" - disabled)
		--> Setting this will force all players on the enemy
		    team to appear to have this model.  Your teammates
		    will retain their models unless you specify
		    g_forcemodel 1, which will force all of your
		    teammates to your current model.
	cg_swapSkins <0|1> (default = 0 - normal team colors)
		--> Allows you to reverse skin colors as displayed
		    on-screen.  Note: announcements, overlays, and
		    the scoreboard will still maintain your "real"
		    server-controlled team color.
- Change: \speclock is not enforced on referees.
- Add: Time debouncer to prevent multiple pauses to be issued by
  seperate referees too close together.
- Fix: Maintaining multi-view viewing across map_restarts.
- Fix: server_maxpacketsmax/min and server_timenudgemax/min
  weren't updating right to clients.
- Fix: Player handicap sometimes getting set to -1.
- Add: \viewfollow on a selected view while multi-viewing will switch
  the viewer into chase mode of the selected player.
- Fix: Occasional NULL snap error for clients.
- Fix: g_weaponrespawn settings from being overwritten on map load.
- Add: Spectator coaching capabilities!  This feature is designed
  to facilitate the new "coach" viewing requirements for competitive
  teamplay.  A coach can:
	- View and rotate through any single player on the assigned team.
	- Multi-view all players on the team at once.
	- Team chat works just as if the coach is a player on the team.
	- Can issue timeouts, lock/unlock, player invite, teamready, etc.
        like a "captain" team member.
	- Can ONLY multiview or chase players on the coached team.

	To become a coach, a member of the team to coach must issue
	the invitation: \coachinvite <player_id>.

	The receiving player can accept with : \coach
	The receiving player can decline with: \coachdecline

	A player can resign as coach for a team at any time by
	issuing: \coachdecline

	The \coach command can be used at anytime to resync viewing
	status of the team (which is given when first becoming a team's
	coach).
	
Sep 27: 0.99i
=============
- Change: Player IDs in the \players command are not colorized if in
  a teamgame.  Also have timenudge in as additional info for each
  player.
- Add: Clamp r_lodCurveError to curb cheaters.
- Add: Clamp handicap during a match to curb cheating.
- Removed: server_125hz variable (replaced with new var below).
- Fix: Small prediction problem with 125Hz sampling.
- Fix: dozens of tweaks and bugfixes on client-side hud interface.
- Add: cg_maxlocationwidth 16, to set maximum locationlength for
  teamoverlay and teamchat when in custom location mode.
- Add: cf_WeaponName sets weaponname font if ch_weaponswitch is 1.
- Update: Changed cf_statusbarammo to cf_ammostatusbar.
- Add: ch_crosshaircolor
	usage: ch_crosshaircainolor 0xRRGGBB|<color>
	color=white, black, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, white, grey
	f.i. ch_crosshaircolor 0xFF3377 will yield some nice weird color.
- Change: ch_crosshaircolor now replaces cg_hud_croshaircolor for custom
  crosshair color in vq3.
- Add: Server-side control of many of the new client options:
       server_maxpacketsmin <value> (minimum client maxpackets)
                                    [Default = disabled]
       server_maxpacketsmax <value> (maximum client maxpackets)
                                    [Default = disabled]
       server_nudgemin <value> (minimum timenudge)
                                    [Default = disabled]
       server_nudgemax <value> (maximum timenudge)
                                    [Default = disabled]
       vote_allow_altgraphics   [default = enabled]
       vote_allow_maxpackets    [default = enabled]
       vote_allow_timenudge     [default = enabled]
       vote_allow_truelightning [default = enabled]

       server_customclient <flags> (default = 0, ALL disabled)
           <flags>:
                  1 - Enable 125Hz sampling.
                  2 - Allow cg_truelightning usage.
                  4 - Custom graphics used with cg_altPlasma and
                      cg_altLightning is allowed.

Sep 23: 0.99h
=============
- Ugh, 1.25 patch breaks everything =(  However, I still have some
  goodies for 1.17 admins/players.
- Fix: Announce message on spectator locking.
- Fix: Failed map votes would still load the map at the end of the
  round.
- Add: Check if r_shownormals is NOT 0 when cheats aren't enabled.
- Change: g_warmup 0 for team.cfg
- Add: cg_truelightning options for non-CPM modes (settings 1 and 2
  are enabled).
- Change: followpowerup is now a client option: cg_followpowerup,
  which defaults to 0.
- Fix: Client crash if using team menu to rotate through teams.
- Fix: CTF score updates on flag status if cg_enableOSPHUD is set
  to 1 (enabled).
- Update: New tweaks for 125Hz sampling.  There are now TWO options.
  Set with:
       cg_125hz 1   -or-
       cg_125hz 2
          Try each one to see which is better for you.
- Add: Server-side control of the 125Hz option:
      server_125hz 0 - Disables 125Hz sampling on client (default)
                   1 - Allows clients to use 125Hz sampling on the server.
- Add: Votable option for 125Hz sampling:
      vote_allow_125hz 1 - Enabled (Default)
- Fix: Player info updates for multi-view.  This sorta breaks multi-
  view demos recorded on 0.99g and played back in 0.99h
- Add: Detection for nopbot quake3.exe hack.
- Add: New server_record option 16 (refer to variables doc on its
  rather limited use for public consumption).
- Add: Option to use alternate graphics for plasma and lightning
  that really look better than baseq3 graphics.
         cg_altPlasma   1 (not default)
         cg_altLighting 1 (not default)
            ---> This requires the use of the extra.pk3 that
                 may or may not be in use on pure servers.
- Add: alias "qtv" to "pure" vote/ref settings.
- Add: spectool.cfg for easier management of all multi-view operations
  while connected and utilizing the multi-view facility.

Sep 18: 0.99g
=============
- Add: Ability for cool floating feature of the scoreboard/scoreboxes.
	cg_float 0 - disables floating (default)
		   1 - enables floating
- Add: 125Hz client sampling feature designed by Alan "Strider" Kivlin.
  This is still experimental, but is showing a lot of promise for
  clients on low-end machines.
	cl_125hz 0 - Disable and use normal Q3 sampling (default)
		   1 - Enable 125Hz client sampling
- Change: \players command now shows cl_maxpackets and snaps informa-
  tion for each client.
- Fix: Various client messages throughout the game.
- Add: MULTI-VIEW SPECTATING!!!!!!  I have to admit, I am still in
  awe of this new feature.  OSP will now allow players to view multiple
  clients on the same screen, with full views of each player's perspecive,
  sounds, armor, health, weapon and ammo.  Demos work fine with this,
  capturing the entire multi-screen view taken by the recording player.
  Here are the commands:
	- viewadd <player_id> - Adds in-game player pov to screen.
	- viewremove [player_id] - Removes currently viewed player pov
					   that is highlighted.  Using the optional
					   player_id field selects the specific
					   player pov to remove.
	- viewred/viewblue - Adds views of the entire red/blue team.  As
				   new players join or leave the team, your
				   screen will be updated.
	- viewnone - Removes all active views
	- viewnext/viewprev - Moves forward/back through views to select
				    which player to listen in on.
				    (Note: follownext/followprev alias to these
				    commands while in multi-view mode).

	--> Ideal key mappings for multi-view viewing:
		bind ";" viewprev
		bind "'" viewnext
		bind backspace viewremove

Aug 26: 0.99f
=============
- Fix: cgame was crashing based on default settings
- Add: max_packet estimator for clients in the \players command.

Aug 25: 0.99e
=============
- Add: Initial release of custom OSP client settings!!  There is way
  too much info to describe here on all the new features, so check out
  the Docs/osp-q3-ClientReadme.txt for the full scoop.  For a quick
  peak without reading the docs, type: \set cg_enableOSPHUD 1
  in the console.  The \menu, \menuright options let you change things
  in-game.
- Add: Initial release of the OSP Config Editor by Shawn "Og" Hampton.
  This is a very cool editor that allows you to configure ALL
  OSP-related (and some default Q3 server) options.  I can't believe
  I've added all these options to Q3 =)
- Add: Lock on client \cl_timenudge setting to prevent too high of a
  setting that is considered cheatable.
- Fix: Demos/screenshots wont be taken when playing back OSP-based
  demos using the OSP cgame.
- Add: Mode name to autorecord demos
- Add: Highlight stats of chased players in \scores list.
- Add: Tweaks to \scores command
- Add: Tweaks to \players command
- Fix: "ready" status in scoreboard
- Fix: Hit sounds in certain scenarios of client .pk3
- Change: Allow ^0 as a color option for names.
- Change: Longer delays between \time calls to prevent accidental
  time-out/time-in in quick succession.
- Fix: On mode config reset, map queue is now properly reloaded.
- Fix: Voting bug for spectators
- Add: Vote info/restrictions while in warmup
- Add: Ability to chase only red or blue team.  Type: "\follow red"
  to rotate through players on the red team and likewise
  "\follow blue" for players on the blue team.
- Add: Big CPM/Promode announcement when CPM is voted in/out.
- Add: Dump of current match stats when a map is voted to restart
  (i.e. \callvote map_restart).
- Add: Fixes on pute vote setting
- Add: Allow skill levels 1-5 with arbitrary \addbot command.
- Add: Teams now have the ability to lock out spectators from
  observing their team, which is a decent anti-cheat mechanism to
  prevent specs from relaying info to players on the other team
  through such facilities as Battlefield Commander, TeamSound, etc.
  To enable this:
	\speclock
		Spectators will then be foced to follow only the other
		team or sit in a fixed position on the map.  If both
		teams issue the \speclock command, then they cant move
		at all, frozen at some viewcam position or intermission
		point.  This command is a toggle, so issuing it again
		will reverse the current speclock setting of the team.
	\specinvite
		This command can be issued to allow a spectator to
		observe a team that has been speclocked.

Jul 30: 0.99d
=============
- Add: New command "autorecord" for clients that allows them to
  create demos with game-specific naming that is auto-generated
  by the server.  Note, this only works for clients who are using
  the OSP cgame.
- Fix: Picking up dropped backpacks in CPM mode under certain
  scenarios.
- Fix: "server_thrufloors" now works as documented for vq3.
- Fix: Hit tones in vq3 modsfacilities e.
- Add: Damage given/received per player in TDM gameplay mode.
- Add: Documentation of the "admin_log" variable for servers.

Jul 25: 0.99c
=============
- Add: Several client cgame tweaks.
- Add: Complete list of client/server commands.
- Change: Rename of info files in the Docs/ directory.
- Add: New .pk3 file: z-osp-extra099b.pk3.  This has several
  client-side updates/enhancements to accomodate the ProMode
  add-on.
- Update: More tweaks on OSP authentication
- Fix: Referee commands now applicable to captain-only commands,
  even while in spectator mode.
- Change: Players can now vote for themselves as ref.
- Fix: Problems with people able to use protected/banned nicks.
- Fix: No per map vote count for referees.
- Add: New client variables for smoke puffs for rl, gl, and sg
  (only for promode):
	cg_smokeradius_rl <value>  (default = 64)
	cg_smokeradius_gl <value>  (default = 32)
	cg_smokegrowth_rl <0|1>  (default = 1)
	cg_smokegrowth_gl <0|1>  (default = 1)
	cg_smoke_sg <0|1>  (default = 1)
- Add: New graphics for lg and pg when under promode.
- Add: Setting to limit # of votes a regular player can make per
  map.  Referees are not affected.  Use a value of 0 to disable
  this limitation.  New variable:  vote_limit  (default = 5)
- Fix: On "pure" vote to disable, the next client can only be
  a QTV client (and thus forced to spec the entire match).
- Fix: Voting for a map in 1v1 no longer makes a player a "loser".
- Add: Tag for servertime in auto-demorecord name for unqiueness.
  Its value is 8 in the server_record bitmask.
- Change: In-eyes view is now the first change of view from the
  starting "observer" mode (again).
- Fix: Specs can now freely chat at intermission, even if mutespecs
  is set to 1 (enabled).
- Fix: ViewCam switching problems if someone is in the process of
  connecting and there are no other players on the server.
- Fix: Weird voiceovers while in warmup or pause.
- Fix: Allow switching to a team before the end of a round in CA.
- Fix: Occasional respawn in teammates bug (id bug)
- Fix: Drop weapon bug
- Change: Entire referee (\ref) command interface.  Just type:
	\ref
  to see a summary of all commands available.
- Add: New client cgame variable for the "view" of the lightning
  gun (promode only):  cg_trueLightning
      0: Default id (lagged) style.
      1: Lightning graphic displayed on crosshair always.
      2: Good mix between server and client view (default).
- Add: All CPM cg_hud* client console variables for HUD changes.
- Add: ProMode (CPM) Q3 playstyle toggle.  ProMode is a tweak on
  the basic game elements to facilitate a faster playing style.
  For complete info on the Challenge ProMode style of play, check
  out http://www.challenge-world.com/.  Big thanks to Khaile for
  giving out the "reference model" ;)  Two new variables associated
  with this new gameplay feature:
	server_promode <0|1>      (default = 0)
	vote_allow_promode <0|1>  (default = 1)

      ---> ProMode gamestyle can be applied to ALL modes of play
           (FFA, 1v1, TDM, CTF, CA).

Jun 08: 0.99a
=============
- Fix: Don't allow vote for self as ref
- Fix: vote_allow_armordamage variable spelled wrong internally
- Fix: match_dropitems now also applies to CTF and flags
- Fix: Slight change in client validation scheme to accomodate
  differences in Win32 and Linux server architectures (which IS
  different) (id bug)
- Fix: CA resetting of scores if match_carespawn is set to 1
- Add: Updated documentation to reflect accurate info on the
  server_record variable.

Jun 03: 0.99
============
- Fix: vote_percent of 100 always failed
- Fix: \r_allready did not work for CA
- Fix: Small CA stats fix
- Fix: Bouncing in CA warmup with hitscan weapons
- Fix: Bot AI "fatal" error
- Add: Ability to allow OSP to run as "baseq3" for UI server browser
  filtering.  This allows server ops to let clients use the in-game
  browser and select their server if the client uses the FFA/1v1/etc.
  filter types.  Server variable:
	osp_gamename  0 - Shows up as "FFA/1V1/TDM/CTF/???"
			  1 - Shows up as "osp" (default)
  ---> Note: To use this properly, you will have to put everything
	 (configs, subdirectories, etc.) in the baseq3/ directory, copy
	 the "game" .pk3 in the paks/ directory into the baseq3/
	 directory and rename it to something like "zzzosp-game099.pk3"
- Add: Ability for callvote to enable/disable "sv_pure" setting of the
  server.  If the server is voted to "sv_pure 0", the server will revert
  back to "sv_pure 1" after a client connects and enters the game
  (ideal for getting a QTV spectator into the game in an easy fashion
  if a server admin is not around).
	vote_allow_pure <0|*1>
- Add: Any connecting player whose name begins with "QTV" will not be
  allowed to enter the game and will skip client authentication (if
  configured with server_ospauth).  Once connected, this player can
  NEVER enter the game nor remove the "QTV" tag from their name.
- Add: 650ms pause of firing after respawn.
- Add: Q2 style armor system.  Yellow = 100 max.  Red = 200 max.
  Armor Shards = 5 and no max.  No countdown of armor.
	armor_q2style 0 - Normal Q3 armor system (default)
			  1 - Q2 style armor system
- Add: Ability to drop weapons/ammo/flags.  Weapon/ammo drop is
  available ONLY in TDM mode.  Flag drop is allowed ONLY in CTF mode
  (and is always available, regardless of server settings).
  Type: \drop for list of items that are droppable:
	vote_allow_dropitems <0|*1>
	match_dropitems  0 - Item dropping disabled (default)
			     1 - Item dropping allowed

	Client command:
	\drop <item_name>
- Add: Initial client-side cgame for OSP-Q3.  This is a very
  barebones client cgame, but it does include functionality for
  auto-demos/screenshots, client-side authentication, and various
  little cleanups of things (like command auto-completion of all
  OSP_specific commands).  It is recommended this be included
  on sv_pure 1 servers and to enable the server_ospauth 1
  variable to eliminate aim/radar cheaters.

May 20: 0.98
============
- Fix: Parser for map/config/filter files.  Problems with spaces/tabs
  not getting stripped between tokens
- Fix: BFG was showing up in warmup items improperly
- Fix: Tweak on CA player stats between matches sometimes carrying
  over if the server is improperly changed via rcon.
- Change: No knockback in CA warmup on opposing players.  Can still
  RJ in warmup to get to areas quicker, however.  This doesn't affect
  normal gameplay.
- Fix: If match_warmupfire is enabled for CA.  Items fired just before
  round start will not do damage once the round has started
  (for example: grenades/rockets/plasma).
- Change: match_warmupfire now defaults to 1 for CA.
- Fix: Maps with configs after a map is over
- Fix: start_armor and start_health documented.  They've been there
  for a while, just forgot to comment them =)
- Change: match_followpowerup is just a default for clients who are
  following.  Clients can manually toggle their current setting with
  the client command: followpowerup
- Tweak: Beginning of performance enhancements: cvar_check

May 16: 0.97
============
- Add: Merged with 1.17 code base (woo! 2 irrelevant #defines)
- Change: Chanmged TDM overtime default to unlimited 5 min overtime
  periods.
- Change: Allow r_kick and r_map at intermission.
- Fix: Certain starting weapon configurations were hosed.
- Change: Kick voting now requires > 75% acceptance.
- Add: Variable acceptance voting percentages:
	vote_percent <value>  (Default = 50)
- Fix: Item banning fixes.
- Add: Players are banned if they mass suicide (1 map only).
- Add: # of votes per map limited to 5 per player (excluding refs).
- Add: r_ban referee command.
- Add: Console commands: ban, filterlist, filterload.
- Hack: Small hack to get bots working.  Will try to make it less
  "hackish" in next rev.
- Add: Additional log entries for CTF_specific events.
- Add: Extensive player filtering capabilities.  Check out the
  Doc/Player-filters-q3.txt file for complete information on the
  format and features available for client filtering (yes, it is
  just more than simple address banning).  Filter file specification:
	filter_file <filename>	(Default = "filters.txt")

May 10: 0.96
============
- Fix: Invalid voting possible for fl/tl/cl/rl
- Fix: Spectator "team" chat in FFA mode
- Fix: \callvote nextmap now works as expected on servers that rotate
  maps.  This option does not work on servers that dont automatically
  rotate maps.
- Change: Timestamp in admin logs
- Change: Redid external config file parsing (maps, configs, etc.) so
  it should be more stable now with fewer surprises on different
  platforms.  Please let me know if any problems arise.
- Add: New viewcam definition files from VK-Hunter.  Thanks man!
	overkill
	q3dm14, q3dm15, q3dm16, q3dm19
	q3tourney1, q3tourney3, q3tourney5
- Add: (Old undocumented option) Forcing minimum player count before
  a game can start:
	
	match_minplayers <value>
		Specifies the minimum # of players that must be in the
		game before they can "ready" up to start the match
		(default = 2).  Note, this option is useful only if
		g_doWarmup = 1 and g_warmup = 0.

- Add: Ability for a map to load an entire server .cfg file, based on
  what is specified in the map queue.  Check the ffamaps.txt file in
  the cfg-maps/ directory for more information.
- Add: Overtime modes.  There are now several ways for OSP to handle
  match overtime periods:
	0 - Sudden Death: Match continues indefinately, first score
	    wins (1v1 default -- id default overtime handling)
	1 - Timed overtime: If the match is still tied after x overtime
	    rounds, the match will move to sudden death with first
	    score to win (Team DM default -- 2 5-minute periods)
	2 - No overtime: matches can end in a tie (CTF default)
	3 - Timed overtime: If match is still tied after x
	    overtime rounds, the match ends in a tie (like hockey).

	----> In the case of timed overtimes, the admin can specify the
		number of overtime periods (0 for unlimited) and the
		length of each overtime period (in terms of minutes).

	----> See the Docs/server-settings-q3.txt file for additional
		information.

May 05: 0.95
============
- Fix: r_remove didnt work quite right
- Add: r_abort referee command.  Allows referee to abort a match in
  progress and move all players to spectator mode.
- Update: Teamplay configs for standard 20min matches.
- Fix: Various item banning fixes
- Fix: CTF maps that dont have initial team player spawn points were
  causing weird respawn problems (e.g. japanctf).
- Add: Ability to not allow players to hurt themselves:
	match_hurtself 0=disabled 1=enabled (default)
- Add: Administrative logging.  This type of logging allows admins to
  see addresses of connecting players, referee attempts and usage,
  votes and their outcomes and other types of events not normally
  found in the game/console logs.  To enable:
	set admin_log <filename>  (Default is "none", which disables
					   administrative logging.)
- Add: New gameplay config: 1v1-Arena.  This is a type of play similar
  to 1v1 rocket arena Quake 1 and Clan Arena mode combined.  Its quite
  fun and very fast.  Good for practicing up on RL tactics =)  Check it
  out!
		arena1v1.cfg

  ---> Note, I've also included 2 maps for use with this mode:
	 carnagearena1b and q3arenax.  If the author can get with me on
	 including it in the official 1.0 release of OSP, I'll feel much
	 better =)

May 02: 0.94
============
- Add: Anti-telefragging feature for respawns.  Note, you can still
  telefrag people by moving through teleporters.
- Add: Forogot to document the vote options for the new CA warmup
  firing and round start respawn features available for players.
  The new vars are:
	vote_allow_ca_startrespawn
	vote_allow_ca_warmupfire
  ---> These variables are thoroughly docuemtned in the
	 server-settings-q3.txt file in the Docs/ directory.
- Add: More lerp prevention to provide smoother transitions on
  sudden scene changes (i.e. from cameras, etc.)
- Fix: Unpausing was problematic under CA.
- Add: r_unlockred/r_unlockblue referee command aliases
- Add: 2 new viewcam definition files: q3dm13 (rework) and q3jdm8a
- Add: Ability for specs to automatically switch to a player who
  picks up an active powerup.  The new server variable to toggle
  this feature is:
	match_followpowerup (0 = off, 1 = on [the default] )
  ---> This only affects players who are following other players
	 and does NOT lock them to the player while the powerup
	 is in effect.

Apr 30: 0.93b - Pre/During/Post RazerCPL build(s)
=================================================
- Wow, it survived RazerCPL pretty well =)  Experimented with some
  client-side stuff that *really* helped in demo/screenshot
  collection that turned out to be fairly robust.  Thanks Dess!
- Add: Ref can talk to all, overriding match_mutespecs option, if
  it is enabled.
- Add: Allow option to shoot during CA warmup period.  This doesnt
  take away ammo/health/armor, just helps players get a feel for
  the lag on the server:
	match_cawarmupfire  * 0 - Warmup firing disabled
				    1 - Warmup firing enabled
- Add: Allow option to force client repsawn on round start in CA.
	match_carespawn  * 0 - Players do NOT respawn on round start.
				 1 - Players *DO* respawn on round start.
- Add: Option to use default id logging format.  I may not have it
  all correct, so someone please tell me if there are still any
  inconsistancies.
	log_default  * 0 - Use OSP-enhanced logging
			   1 - Usae default id logging format
- Add: More sound bug tweaks.
- Fix: All chat stuff for all modes (1v1 was especially affected)
- Change: Rearranged spec mode ordering.  Order is now: freefloat,
  ViewCam, and then Follow.
- Change: Health/Armor info not reported during a CA round in the
  \scores command.
- Add: q3tourney4 ViewCam definition file.
- Add: team_weaponrespawn in the server_settings_q3.txt document.
- Add: replace_* variables in the server_settings_q3.txt document.
- Change: Hook restrictions are now at 2000/2000 with default
  changed to 1200/950.  Have fun =)
- Add: Client autorecord (Requires OSP client cgame):
	server_record  * 0 - Clients do NOT auto-record matches
			     1 - Clients have forced demo record.
- Add: Client-side cgame verification (requires OSP client cgame).
  This option is used in conjunction with the sv_pure settings of
  a server to fight client .exe hacks that bypass "pure" settings:
	server_ospauth  * 0 - Client cgame modules are not verified
				1 - Client cgame modules must register
				    with the server.

Apr 09: 0.92
============
- Add: Option to not have viewcam track players and use static
  views.  New command is: "\vc_view" to toggle views locking.
- Add: Use the "USE_ITEM" key (+button2) to toggle cam viewlock.
- Add: Ping copy option for specs following players:
	server_realping	* 0 - Copies the chased player (id default)
				  1 - Shows real ping of spec
- Fix: Player stats not showing in CA at end of match if a player
  has died during the round.
- Fix: No end-level announcement if a map is voted in.
- Change: team_allcaptain now defaults to 1
- Add: Aliased "\pause" to work as the same as "\time" and "\r_pause"
- Fix: Overhaul of the pausing system to prevent weirdo corner
  cases from occurring.
- Add: Health/armor/modifier logging:
	log_stat	* 0 - Disabled
			  1 - Logs all health/armor-related events,
				but no dump to console.
			  2 - Logs everything and dumps to console.
	----> This is a LOT of logging.  If you are going to use
		it, I advise to use option 1 to avoid slowdowns from
		console updates.
- Change: Logfile times now in ss.s notation (seconds and tenths of
  seconds).
- Fix: Line parsing for external file reading tweaked.  Should
  address some of the problems Linux users were seeing where the
  last character of a line was being cut off.
- Add: Logging of player accuracy stats at the end of a match.
- Add: 2 new console commands:
	pause		- Pauses the server
	allready	- Readies all players up
- Fix: Spurious nextmap messages for CA mode that rotates maps at
  match end.
- Fix: Floating point output for QVM on |values| < 1.
- Change: Refs can be voted in only if there are 3 players IN the
  game (2 for 1v1).
- Note: Try to remove any extra linefeeds in viewcam files to prevent
  weird 0,0,0 positions (will fix).
- Update: More tweaks on Score_* public server cvars.
- Add: "allcaptians" as a vote option.
	vote_allow_allcaptains	(default = 1)
- Add: "thrufloors" as a vote option to toggle damage through floors.
	vote_allow_thrufloors	(default = 1)
- Fix: The "mutespecs" option now also applies to 1v1 mode as well.
- Fix: On map rotation in 1v1, loser wouldn't get pushed to spec mode.
- Change: Hook speeds.  Default is now 900/800, max is 1200/900.
- Change: "Shoot through floors" option now specified as:
	server_thrufloors   0 - Disables splash through floors
				* 1 - Enables splash through floors (id default)
- Fix: Server crash on rcon'd server changes and a map_restart issued.
  (Thanks ]R[Papa).
- Fix: Last but *definately* not least: Several fixes to id's internal
  event system.  These changes (in conjunction with ]R[Papa and Strider)
  now decrease the likelihood of dropped sounds in Q3A dramatically.
  Its still not perfect, but it is a whole lot better now, for sure.

Mar 30: 0.91
============
- Add: Many more viewcam definition files.  These aren't yet
  set in stone, so if you have alternates or improvements on
  the included viewcam definition files, then by all means,
  send them in!  Still missing a few on several of the default
  id maps (hint hint).
- Change: Voted refs now survive across level loads
- Add: Shoot through floors option toggle:
	match_thrufloors	0 - No blast damage through floors
			     *1 - Default Quake3 behavior
- Fix: Ref auto-pass votes
- Fix: Persistant ready info on 1st round of CA
- Add: Announce people becoming referees
- Fix: Dont give loss if switching to spec in warmup for 1v1
- Add: Auto reset of voted parameters on server after 10min
  of inactivity (no clients connected)
- Add: Viewcam now tracks quad/flag carriers automatically
- Add: Allow "ref" command in intermission
- Tweak: Public cvar reduction/changes
- Fix: Public info on matches was not updating in certain
  circumstances.
- Cleanup: A lot of small message cosmetics throughout many
  areas of the mod.
- Update: Some floating point operations in the qvm have
  been enhanced with greater precision (id issue)
- Change: Voting cosmetics on what has been voted in.
- Add: OSP URL on opening plug
- Add: Referee "vote" is now announced as a "referee change"
  rather than a vote to reduce confusion.
- Add: Ability to specify any bot name in the "addbot"
  command.  So, something like:

	\addbot my_bot

  Will load a bot without any errors.  Just makes it easier
  to add a bot without having to remember all the parameters =)
  The actual bot character and skill is calculated on the
  numeric representation of the name you provide.
- Add: Ability to load custom bots easily on server start:
	set bot_autoload "bot1 bot2 ... botN"
  This command just acts like you have issued consecutive
  "addbot" commands on server startup.
- Note: Snapshots are also written to the games.log file in
  case you forget to do a \condump after camming a level.
- Note: Found that if sv_pure is set to 1 for listen servers,
  strange things can happen on map reload.  I've adjusted
  the "cfg-SinglePlayer" configs to reflect this.
- Add: Additional OPTIONAL paramter on viewcam positions to
  dynamically change the range on a particular position.
  For example, the \snapshot command can dump something like
  this:

	5 668.980 2338.872 173.705 42.709 -88.748

  The position for each viewcam can also be augmented with a
  length argument:

	5 668.980 2338.872 173.705 42.709 -88.748 [length]

  So to change from the default 450 range to say, 900, FOR
  THIS PARTICULAR POSITION, just change the original line
  (by hand) to:

	5 668.980 2338.872 173.705 42.709 -88.748 900

  This is especially helpful for covering wide open areas
  where too many viewcams can get to be confusing and
  cause a lot of quick position changes.

  Note: NOT specifying a range will just have the position
  default to the normal 450 range.

Mar 25: 0.9
===========
- Add: Put player IDs in cvars to show who is playing.
	For team-based games:
		Players_Red
		Players_Blue

	For all others:
		Players_Active

	The IDs correspond to the player IDs you see given
	in the server's player info fields.

- Add: Respawn configuration for items in Team DM:
	team_weaponrespawn (default = 30)
- Fix: Reset reload time just when a CA match starts.
- Fix: Don't allow gaunlet damage in CA warmup.
- Fix: Telefrags now only add 100 points to damage_given stats.
- Fix: Buffer ref and team timeouts.
- Fix: Allow auto-map rotation in CA.
- Fix: Also now removes items that are spawned by triggers if
  the item is banned by the admin.
- Add: "map_halt" to absolutely prevent the next level/map from
  loading (good for big FFA tourneys.. hint hint =) )
- Add: Bot load time intervals
	bot_checktime (default = 10)
- Add: All ALL memebers on a team to have limited captain privys:
	team_allcaptain (default = 0)

	A refere can also toggle this with:
		r_allcaptain

	----> The normal "captain" is still assigned and can be the
		only one to remove players.  All other players can
		invite and call a time-out.
- Fix: Small map rotation bug fix for min_players = 0 setting.
- Add: Ref command for mutespecs option (r_mutespecs)
- Add: Option for armor during warmup
	warmup_armor (default = 0)
- Add: Honor server sv_maxrate setting (if set) in \players
  listing.
- Change: The "Score_Time" server var now properly reflects start
  and end times, and is also updated every 7 seconds.  It also shows
  various match-ending info.
- Add: Play team lead/tied announcement at the end of a team-based
  match.
- Add: Win by margin mode.  This allows the server admin to have a
  match end based on point-spread rather than reaching a particular
  fraglimit.  This value, in conjunction with a low fraglimit, can
  help speed up 1v1 matches.  Consider it as a "skunked" factor in
  the game.  For instance, with a defined point spread of 10 and a
  fraglimit of 15, a 1v1 match could end on a score of 15-10, 11-1,
  or even 6 - -4 =)

	match_winbyscore (default = 0 [DISABLED])

- Change: The FIRE button now cycles through free-float, chase and
  viewcam modes.  Use the jump/croutch keys to cycle through players
  in chase/viewcam modes.
- Updated all relevent documentation.
- Add: New spectator viewing mode: the ViewCam.  This is a home-brewed
  viewing mode that is most like the views seen in the game: Nocturne.
  The viewcam is a cinematic view of the game that gives action cut
  -scenes for a better "feel" for the action.  There are several ways
  to use the viewcam.  To enable:
	- Type: \viewcam in the console
	- Join: \team vc
	- Cycle through to it when in spectator mode

  This mode of operation will always locate the most action going
  on in the map.  To manually move to different viewcam locations,
  type:
	\vc_free

	----> This option toggles either manual or automatic viewcam
		positioning.

  You can optionally track a single player with this mode through:
	\vc_follow

  To follow a SPECIFIC player, type:
	\vc_follow [PLAYER_ID|PLAYER_NAME]

	----> Note you can just cycle through to a player using the
		jump/croutch keys as well.

  The viewcam positions are defined by configuration files that are
  map-specific.  Right now, OSP has viewcam definition files only for
  maps: q3ctf1, q3ctf2, q3dm5, q3dm6, and q3dm7.  I plan on incor-
  porating these into the mod/maps at some point, but there will
  always be the option to override with .cfg files.

  Creating new viewcam definition files is pretty easy and kinda
  fun =)  All the documentation you will need (+ additional commands)
  is given in the included Docs/Viewcam-info.txt file.

  If you make viewcam definition files that are not included with
  the OSP distribution, please send them to me and I will include
  them in the next release.  Full credits will of course be given.
  Please!  For the love of God!  Make some new viewcam def files!!

Mar 17: 0.8
===========
- First official public beta release!
- Add: Current server setting of a vote option is displayed
  even if its corresponding vote option is disabled when the
  vote is attempted.
- Add: Blurb in \r_help to referees that vote commands are
  also available as additional "commands".
- Fix: Potenetial buffer overflows (id bug)
- Fix: Still showed CA win info even after all players have
  left.
- Change: Remove maxpackets info from \players command.
- Change: Keep scores from last CA match in first round
  of next match (during warmup).
- Merged with 1.16n source
- Add: Precache weapons if players are configured to respawn
  with them, but they are not available on the current map.
- Add: The hook!  New server vars:
	hook_enable <0|1>		(default = 0 (off))
	hook_sky	<0|1>		(default = 0 (off))
	hook_holdtime <secs> 	(default = 3 seconds)
	hook_delaytime <msecs>	(default = 400 milliseconds)
	hook_speed <value>	(default = 600)
	hook_speedpull <value>	(default = 600)

	----> And yes, the model DO croutch when hooking for
		better asthetics.  The hitbox is still the same
		as if they were standing, however.

Mar 14: 0.71
============
- Add: Dump both player stats at the end of a 1v1 match.
- Fix: (id bug) No spawnpoints on q3tourney3 if in teamplay
  mode.  I hacked this fix in the server, so no need for any
  custom q3tourney3 maps to fix this error.
- Fix: Redid the variable wipe when a config mode vote is
  passed.  This should allow for greater server flexibility
  that use both command line args or for listen server
  operators, while still resetting the critical OSP variables.
- Fix: Bots no longer shoot each other in ClanArena mode.
- Fix: Bots no longer included in "players ready" count for
  match play.
- Add: Vote announcement is also center-printed.
- Add: Configs for single player/bot matches.
- Fix: Stats were being carried over in FFA mode.
- Fix: Small bug in config-mode file read (last char was
  getting chopped).
- Cleanup: Various messages and vote info.
- Change: "team_damagearmor" to "team_armordamage" in CA mode.
- Add: 2 new voting options (both default to "ON" (1)):
	vote_allow_armordamage (for armor damage in CA mode)
	vote_allow_falling (for falling damage enable/disable)
 
Mar 11: 0.7
===========
- Add: Armor damage for self-inflicted blasts.  This is ONLY
  for CA mod:
	set team_damagearmor   0 - No loss of armor
				   * 1 - Loss of armor (20% of dmg)
- Fix: Clear "ready" markers on match start for CA.
- Fix: No ammo reset if held ammo > 200.
- Add: Mode "config" voting.  This option deprecates the
  previous "gametype" voting with a more flexible ability for
  server ops to specify entire server configurations to be
  voted upon that allow for fine-tuning each mode of play.
  This new format also allows for server ops to specify a
  default config that the server will fall back upon after
  all clients leave for 10 minutes.

	mode_default <default server config>
		Specifies the server configuration that the server
		will roll back to after 10 minutes of no clients
		connected, while the server is not in the default
		configuration (default = "none").

	mode_file <mode specification config>
		Specifies the name / config of each server config
		available for voting.  The "name" is what clients
		vote for, while the "config" is the server config
		that will be execed if the vote passes.  These
		alternate modes of play can be disabled for voting
		if the value for "mode_file" is set to "none"
		(the default).

	----> The configs that are to be used in the mode config
		voting *must* have a "map" command as the very
		last statement in the config file.

	----> Server vars are completely erased when a new config
		is voted in, so make sure you have the critical
		variables (like rconPassword and ref_password) set
		in all votable configs for consistancy's sake.

	----> The included "ffa.cfg" shows an example of the
		correct settings and mode-config .cfg file to enable
		these features.

- Removed: All of the "vote_allow_mode*" variables are no
  longer honored as the config voting has fully taken its place.
  If you dont update with the new config files included with this
  release, then please delete these entries in your existing
  server .cfg files.
- Update: In preparation for an official release, I've reorganized
  the layout of the osp/ directory and freshened all server .cfg
  files to the latest settings.  I've also started adding the
  qagame.qvm to a .pk3 for better compatibility with the Quake3
  executable.  Please delete the vm/ directory and its contents
  and replace it with this new .pk3.  I also HIGHLY advise adjusting
  your server configs with this latest set of config files.  Yes,
  this is beta software, and it DOES change, but change is good =)

Mar 08: 0.67a
=============
- Fix: End-of-level timelimit crash bug (doh!)
- Change: railctf.cfg format

Mar 08: 0.67
============
- Fix: No joincode dumped at match start if match_latejoin
  is set to 1 (or higher).
- Add: Highlight vote messages for better clarity.
- Note: New beta release (1.16m) require sv_pure to be set
  on the command line (it defaults to 1 on load).
- Fix: Plasmagun does NOT show up now in CTF warmup if it
  is disabled (i.e. railCTF.cfg).
- Fix: stats/scores console dump doesnt occur if a map is
  changed during warmup.
- Fix: Scores and damage scoring residuals would be carried
  over for surviving players in CA mode after a match is
  finished.
- Fix: "Score" column in CA mode showed damage + kills, not
  damage/100 + kills.
- Add: "Sudden death" tie in FFA if it is a time-based match
  (i.e. timelimit with no fraglimit) is fixed (id bug).  Tie-
  breakers are listed below.  Result is that what the order
  shows on the scoreboard is the correct ordering.
- Add: Frag ties still sort players by additional parameters.
  The format is as follows:
	1. Player score (most)
	2. Player deaths (least)
	3. Player suicides (least)
	4. Damage Given (most)
	5. Damage Received (least)
	6. First player to achieve the higher rank (rare)

Mar 06: 0.66
============
- Fix: Callvote on item/powerup enable/disable apparently
  triggered some bug in the qvm.  It worked in the .dll
  version of OSP-Q3.. I swear!
- Fix: Callvote map by ID now shows the mapname correctly
  in the vote announcement.
- Fix: In CA, dead specs shows proper team colors (not all
  red as it used to be).
- Fix: Honor match_latejoin 0 in FFA if g_doWarmup is set.
  Late-connecting players are forced to spectator mode until
  the end of the match.
- Change: Referees can vote on ANY vote option (and have it
  pass immediately) even if the server has the vote option
  disabled.
- Fix: "ready" now works properly under FFA if g_doWarmup is
  set to 1.
- Add: "READY" shows up for a player on the scoreboard when
  they ready up to start a match.  Been meaning to do this
  for a while =D
- Fix: Can now properly vote-kick players that have a space
  in their name.

Mar 03: 0.65
============
- Add: Option to specify starting health when a player
  respawns.  Server var:
	start_health <value> (default = 125)
- Change: g_forcerespawn defaults to 10 in 1v1, 20 in all
  other modes.
- Fix: Stats in 1v1 mode were hosed.
- Add: Ability to change weapons/ammo on a map:
	replace_machinegun <item_mask> (default = 1)
	replace_shotgun	 <item_mask> (default = 2)
	replace_glauncher  <item_mask> (default = 4)
	replace_rlauncher  <item_mask> (default = 8)
	replace_lightning  <item_mask> (default = 16)
	replace_railgun	 <item_mask> (default = 32)
	replace_plasmagun  <item_mask> (default = 64)
	replace_bfg		 <item_mask> (default = 128)

	----> Note: replacing a weapon for another also
		replaces the ammo for that weapon.  The
		<item_mask> setting uses the HIGHEST bit
		in order to specify the weapon.  Suggest
		using only exact values for weapons to
		replace with the right weapon.

Mar 02: 0.64
============
- Change: Added end-level sound (for time-based games) and
  changed time-out sound.
- Add: Additional logging for special events (votes, timeouts,
  etc.)
- Add: Per-item vote banning/allowances.  New server vars are:
	vote_allow_items <item_mask> (default = 1023)
	vote_allow_powerups <powerup_mask> (default = 255)

	---> These values are derived from a sum of the the
	     values found in the item_mask and powerup_mask
	     specifications.  Defaults are to allow vote on ANY
	     item.  Note, for items, only the BFG can be voted
	     upon.  This DOES work for ent-teams, where a
	     powerup can cycle between different powerup types
	     (i.e. q3dm10: invis, regen, quad).

- Add: Voting for g_forcerespawn variable.  New server var is:
	vote_allow_spawn <0|1> (default = 1).
- Add: Allow for gauntlet damage settings.  Server var is:
	gauntlet_damage <value> (default = 50).
- Fix: No accuracy hits for hitting teammates.
- Add: Allow \players command at intermission.
- Add: 3-column output for map listings.

Feb 27: 0.63
============
- Add: Can now specify map by number in map voting.
- Fix: Players can't join full teams in CA during intermission.
- Fix: Stat resets for TDM/CTF/1v1 when matches commence.
- Fix: More Score_Time cvar enhancements.
- Fix: 1v1 win tracking.
- Fix: \team any to join any available team.  Anything besides
  standard "r", "red", "b", "blue", "s", or "spectator" puts
  a player in free spec mode.
- Fix: Joincode msg not showing up when a match starts in TDM/CTF.
- Fix: More on player removal problems from teams when a map reloads.
- Fix: Scoreboard not showing when a map is voted while in warmup.
- Add: "NET" stat for TDM scores console dump.  NET is the overall
  contribution a player gives to his/her team.  It is computed as
  follows:  NET = kills - deaths - suicides - team kills
- Add: Allow \stats and \scores command during intermission.
- Change: \stats by a spectator now defaults to statistics on the
  player he/she is chasing (except in CA mode).
- Add: Per powerup banning.  Can now ban powerups on a case by
  case basis.  This works even for entity "teams" that rotate
  through several different powerups/items, so you can disable
  one type of powerup without worry of losing the other
  powerups/items in the "team":

  ---> Use:  powerup_disable <powerup_mask>

	powerup_mask
	------------
	* 0	- No powerups diabled (default)
	  1	- Quad Damage
	  2	- Battlesuit
	  4	- Haste
	  8	- Regeneration
	  16	- Invisibility
	  32	- Flight
	  64	- Teleported
	  128	- Medkit

  ---> as a result, the powerup value in item_disable has been
	 removed.  Its new values are now:

	item_mask
	------------
	* 0	- No items diabled
	  1	- All armor
	  2	- All health
	  4	- BFG
	  8	- Machinegun
	  16	- Shotgun
	  32	- GrenadeLauncher
	  64	- RocketLauncher
	  128	- LightningGun
	  256	- PlasmaGun
	  512	- RailGun

   *** MAKE SURE YOU CHANGE YOUR CONFIGS TO REFLECT THIS UPDATE !! ***
	---> All of the shipped configs reflect these latest changes.

Feb 25: 0.62
============
- Add: Parameter for inter-round countdown in CA.  This applies
  ONLY after the first round has been played:  match_roundtimer
  (default = 10).  Note, u cant set this below 2 or above 20.
- Fix: Spec muting parameter now fixed to apply ONLY to specs.
  Also did some fixups on 1v1 spec chats as well.
- Add: Used fraglimit value in CA mode to show the roundlimit
  next to team scores on the player hud.  No, u cant set frag-
  limit directly, OSP just uses it to trick the client cgame
  into displaying the roundlimit as the fraglimit.
- Fix: At end of 1v1, loser didnt get bumped from the game
  properly.
- Fix: 1v1 map voting
- Change: Can now cycle maps in 1v1 after the end of each match
  by setting map_cycle to 1 in the server .cfg.
- Fix: Console scoreboards weren't showing accurate stats for
  players that were chasing other players (mostly applies to CA).
- Change: CA scoreboard layout.  It now always displays the
  winning team last on end of round scoreboard dump to more easily
  see player health/armor status.
- Add: Clamp maximum delay on end-of-level CA intermission to
  7 seconds.
- Fix: CA now properly zeros out match info if players leave.
- Fix: Another attempt at fixing team kicks on level restart
  in CA mode.

Feb 23: 0.61
============
- Fix: Attempt at fixing a small case where players occasionally
  do not rejoin their team when next round starts in CA.
- Add: Server/vote option to mute spectators during a match:
	Server: match_mutespecs <0|1> (default = 0 [off])
	Vote: vote_allow_mutespecs <0|1> (default = 1 [on])
	----> This only works for teamplay modes of play, and
		only mutes spectators when a match is in progress.
		They can still talk during warmups between matches,
		for example, in CA.
- Change: Falling damage is fully a dmflag setting now for CA.
  The dmflag value is 8 for no_falling_damage, which is set by
  default for CA mode of play.
- Fix: Match stats shown for ALL players now in CA.
- Add: More "Score_Time" external cval fixups
- Tweaks: more on button timers for follow/end-level
- Change: Reformatted CA "\scores" scoreboard
- Fix: Cases for players dropping items even when weapon_deaddrop
  was disabled.
- Change: Players can now join a team at match intermission
  (primarily for anxious players in CA).
- Add: "start_armor" setting.  The default is 0 for all modes of
  play, except CA, which defaults to 200.

Feb 22: 0.6
===========
- Add: New "server-settings-Q3.txt" document that clearly describes
  all new custom variables for OSP-Q3.
- Change: Redid all config files into a cleaner format.
- Add: INSTALL.txt info file.
- Add: New field in maplist format: <roundlimit> at the end.  Don't
  worry, if you don't care about this value, it defaults to the
  current server setting.  So you dont HAVE to update all of your
  maplist files =)
- Add: Respawning in warmup gives you all the weapons on the
  CURRENT map to, well, warm up with.
- Fix: Server will go to the next map even if no clients are
  connected.  It is annoying connecting to an empty server, only
  to have to wait the intermissiontime.
- Change: Level doesnt immediately change when a map is voted in.
  Clients are taken to the intermission first.
- Fix: Sanity checks on some server variables
- Add: Can now view stats from previous level until warmup is over.
  Of course, this only works with modes where g_doWarmup is set.
- Fix: Small 1v1 bug that can cause a match reset
- Fix: Made following players less difficult by putting in a 1
  second timer between button presses.  The original format was
  a bit trigger happy (i.e. 2-3 clients with 1 button press)
  (id bug)
- Fix: Put a timer debounce on end-level "READY" status, so its
  easier to keep it on a particular state (id bug)
- Fix: External timer cvar was negative during timeouts.
- Add: Clan Arena support.  This is g_gametype "5" mode of play
  under Quake3.  Clan Arena is a basic form of the popular
  Rocket Arena mod, designed for fast pickup teamplay or 1v1.
  It is a match-play mode of play, rather than a strict frag-
  based format.  The only real additional server variables
  for this are:
	roundlimit - Specifies the number of rounds a team needs
			 to win in order to win the match (default = 7)
	vote_allow_modeCA - Obvious
	vote_allow_roundlimit - Obvious

  --> A more detailed description of this mode will be described
	later, but suffice it to say the basic rules are this:
		1. You cant hurt yourself or your teammates
		2. No falling damage
		3. Can't hurt others or lose ammo in warmup mode
		4. No respawning when match begins
		5. When you die, you go to spectator mode until the
		   end of the round.
		6. A team wins a round when all players on the opposing
		   team have been eliminated.
		7. A team wins the match if they have won <roundlimit>
		   rounds.
		8. After a match is won, team scores are rest to 0 to
		   start again.
		9. *BONUS*  You carry all weapon stats throughout the
		   entire match!
		10. *BONUS* You get 1 fragpoint for every 100 points
		    of damage you inflict!

Feb 18: 0.52
============
- Fix: Another small map rotate bug that can happen occassionally.
- Add: External cvar info strings for time remaining in the match.
  It is called: "Score_Time" and fits nicely below the "Score_Red"
  if your cvars are sorted alphabetically (like in GameSpy).  This
  shows up for teamplay, 1v1, and FFA matches alike.
- Fix: CTF team scores now accurately shown in external vars.
- Fix: CTF scoreboard now shows up in end-level dump.

Feb 17: 0.51
============
- Fix: Map rotation was seriously hosed in several ways.
- Fix: The included configs were a bit problematic, look better
  now.

Feb 17: 0.5
===========
****************************************************************
- NOTE: I *seriously* recommend that server operators put:
	+cvar_restart
  on the command line when invoking a server.  Q3 likes to
  save defined variables in q3config.cfg regardless if it is
  a server or a client.  Therefore, if you start playing around
  with settings on one server, and load another server expecting
  defaults, dont be surprised if you see settings that were
  defined on one server but not defined in the other server.
  To safegaurd, add the above-mentioned +cvar_restart command
  during server launch.  You CANNOT add this to the config file
  for dedicated servers.
****************************************************************
- Add: Made 2 more reference configs: rail.cfg and railctf.cfg
  The original instagib mod (OSP TOurney DM for Quake2) is now
  alive in Q3!! =)
- Add: External cvars for team scores.  They should show up in
  stuff like GameSpy as: "Score_Red" and "Score_Blue"
- Fix: Small buffer overflow on captains command
- Fix: Accuracy hits with shotgun/railgun (it was an id bug
  actually)
- Fix: Specs can chat to players during timeouts on 1v1
- Fix: map_restart voting.  Before it would actually reload
  the map.  Now it just rests the match.
- Add: Switch on wether players drop weapons when they are killed
  	weapon_deaddrop	(Default: 1 - Players drop weapons when
				 they are killed)
- Add: \scores information for FFA matches.  This info includes
  player times and FPH (Frags Per Hour) ratings.
- Goof: Forgot to comment the map cariables in the last release
	map_file	Specifies file containing map info
			(Default = "maps.txt")
	map_queue	0 - Disable using the map queue
		    * 1 - Map queue is loaded and enabled (default)

	map_rotate	0 - Map queue is enabled, but maps arent
			    cycled at the end of a match (server stays
			    on the same map until the current map is
			    voted out).
		    * 1 - Maps are cycled at the end of each match.
			    (default)

	map_random	0 - Step through the map list in the order it
			    is specified.
		    * 1 - Maps are randomly picked in the map queue.
			    (default)

	map_once	0 - No guarantee that a map will not be picked
			    more times than any other map (if random
			    cycling is enabled).
		    * 1 - Guarantees that a map will only be picked
			    once in an entire cycling of the map queue.
			    (default)

	map_nocount
		    * 0 - Honors the min/max player settings as
			    specified by the map queue.
			1 - Ignores player counts and freely selects
			    any map in the map queue.

- Add: Item banning.  Variable:
	item_disable <item_mask>	(Default = 0)
	
	item_mask:
	----------
	0	- No items diabled
	1	- All powerups
	2	- All armor
	4	- All health
	8	- BFG
	16	- Machinegun
	32	- Shotgun
	64	- GrenadeLauncher
	128	- ReocketLauncher
	256	- LightningGun
	512	- PlasmaGun
	1024	- RailGun

	---> Note, when a weapon is disabled, its associated
	     ammo is also removed.

- Add: Initial player weapon inventory.  Variable:
	start_have <weapon_mask>  (cumulative)
- Add: Initial player starting weapon.  Variable:
	start_weapon <weapon_mask> (most significant bit order)

	weapon_mask:
	------------
	1	- Machinegun
	2	- Shotgun
	4	- GrenadeLauncher
	8	- RocketLauncher
	16	- LightningGun
	32	- Railgun
	64	- PlasmaGun
	128	- BFG

- Add: Initial player ammo inventories.  Variables:

	start_bullets	(Default: 50 teamplay/100 all else)

Feb 15: 0.4
===========
- Add: CTF-specific match stats.  Stuff like caps, defends, etc.
  This info is dumped at the end of a match, or anytime the
  \scores command is issued.
- Add: CTF-specific syntax highlighting.  Allows one to see
  important messages more clearly:
	Yellow : Something is happening to a flag
	Green  : Someone has captured a flag
	Magenta: A flag carrier has been killed
	Cyan   : Defense or other bonus award
- Fix: Small id bug for people who in-eyes another player then
  join the match.
- Add: Map rotation.  This system allows server ops to specify
  what maps to rotate through as well as limit what maps players
  can pick.  Not only does this eliminate playing bad maps, but
  it also fixes an id bug in the voting system.  This map
  rotation also allows the admin to specify player counts for
  maps to prevent inappropriate loading of large maps with
  small # of players, or vice-versa.  Admins also have the
  option to specify fraglimit/capturelimit/timelimit for each
  map when it loads or is voted upon.  The sample ffamaps.cfg
  is just a first approximation on decent player counts and
  frag/time limits.  I would appreciate feedback on these
  map configurations for more desirable settings.  Same goes
  for the team/ctf/1v1 map settings.

Feb 12: 0.34
============
- Add: "resign" captain command that allows the captain of a team
  to resign his/her captainship and optionally assign it to
  another teammate.
- Add: Allow voting in of referees.  Requires at least 3 people
  on the server to enable the vote (new server cvar is:
  vote_allow_referee  Default = 0 (disabled)).
- Fix: Timelimit vote enable was incorrect.
- Fix: Losing flags in CTF if a timeout or pause was enforced.
- Fix: Players cannot pickup flags in CTF if the match is in
  warmup (general id bug).
- Add: More referee commands:
	r_lockred	(locks red team)
	r_lockblue	(locks blue team)
	r_putred <player_id>	(puts a player on the red team)
	r_putblue <player_id>	(puts a player on the blue team)
	r_promote <player_id>	(promotes player to captain)

Feb 10: 0.32
============
- Added "resign" function for teamplay.  Allows
  a player to resign captainship either randomly,
  or to another player specifically.
- Added the ability to vote for referees.  It
  requires at least 3 players on the server,
  and is strip after each map load. (New
  server var is: vote_allow_referee)
- Small fix in allowing timelimit to be voted
  upon.
- Redid some messages for consistancy.

Feb 09: 0.3
===========
- Reset client timers after a pause/timeout
- Fixed some weapon stats info
- Reorganized some server variable names to not
  confuse with id's semantics.
- Added "referee" status for admin control of
  matches.  Several commands are available for
  use only by the referee (i.e. match pause,
  readyall, change map, remove players from
  teams, etc.).  Also, ANYTHING the referee
  votes for WILL immediately pass or fail,
  depending on how he/she votes.
- Timeouts/pauses now FULLY pause clients
  approriately.  Also added sound cues when
  a pause starts and stops.  Its pretty cool,
  actually =)
- Fixed id's "talking-gauntlet" bug.
- A stab at trying to determine players'
  cl_maxpackets setting.  Its in the \players
  command output for now.  It may be temporary
  if id decides to provide this information to
  the game server.
- Added joincodes for players to enter during
  the match without having captains unlock or
  invite them in.  Pretty simple with auto-
  generated codes at the start of a match
  (4 letters only).
- Added sv_floodprotect and capturelimit as
  votable items.  Map rotation/selection will
  come in next version =)
- Various little voting fixes and other small
  enhancements.
