
Challenge ProMode Arena: Commands
---------------------------------
Date: 22 Jun 03


This document gives information on all available commands (and their
options) for CPMA, for both clients and at the server console.

All commands that require a parameter can be issued without the
parameter to gain additional information on the command's current
setting even if the command itself is disabled.

The notation used in the commands described herein uses the common
Unix semantics in specifying if a parameter is optional or required:

  - Any parameter description enclosed with < ... > is required.
  - Any parameter description enclosed with [ ... ] is optional.

Some of the commands given below also specify "player_id" as an optional
or required parameter.  This "player_id" information is the numeric ID
number assigned to a player when connecting to the server.  To find
the associated player_id of a player, issue the "\players" command to
view a listing of all playernames and their associated "player_id".

Note: all of the commands listed below are in addition to the commands
      that are shipped with the default Quake3 game.


====================================
General commands (all modes of play)
====================================

accuracy		Shows best player for each weapon. Adding 
			<weapon_id> shows all player stats for that
			specific weapon. (Alias: topshots)

autorecord		Creates demo with consistant naming scheme

+button5                Use the offhand hook/grapple, if the server allows it.

callvote <params>       Calls a vote.  The list of available <parameters>
                        is given later in this document.

currenttime/time        Displays current local time.

help                    List of available commands for the particular
                        mode of play on the server (Alias: commands).

maplist			Display available maps for current mode

motd                    Views server's current MOTD.

mvd			Create a multiview demo (all players POVs).

players                 Lists all active players and their server ID
                        (This ID is needed for other commands, as shown
                        below).  Additional info on client is also given.

speconly                Toggles client's involvement in the 1v1 queue.
                        If enabled, then clients will never join a 1v1
                        game.  They will remain spectators the entire
                        time they are connected.  Disabling "speconly"
                        will put the client back to the end of the queue
                        to begin playing again.

stats [player_ID]       Shows weapon accuracy stats for a player. If no
                        ID is given, shows stats for the current player
                        (or if following a player, shows the stats of
                        the player being followed).

+wstats                 Displays current stats while playing or of the
                        player being followed (if a spectator).  In
                        multiview, the stats of the player of the

*NOTE*: All vote options are also available, as any vote a referee calls
        will ALWAYS pass immediately.  This allows the referee to modify
        all server settings shown in the \callvote list.
        The "ref" command can be used to achieve the same effect.


==========================
Voting Commands/Parameters
==========================

The following options are available under the "callvote" facility of CPMA.
Most options are called with a parameter of "0" or "1" to signal "OFF" or
"ON" (0=OFF/DISABLE, 1=ON/ENABLE).

You can get a list of all votable options in the game by typing:

    \callvote ?

by itself with no option name.  This will list all available server
options to vote upon, based upon the current gametype being played on
the server.

You can also get the usage, description and current setting info of
most server variables by simply typing:

    \callvote <option_name> ?

without any parameter.  For example, you can get the server's current
settings to see which items and weapons are enabled or disabled by typing:

    \callvote items ?

See the docs/Server.txt file for details of all the votes.


===============
Server Commands
===============

The following command-list describes the commands available on the
server console.  Note, all console commands that shipped with the
default Quake3 game are available.

addbot              If issued with a non-default quake3 bot name, CPMA
                    will deterministically load a bot definition with
                    a determined skill level.  This selection is based
                    on the bot's numeric representation of its name.
                    Thus, the same bot will be selected when its name
                    is given, every time.

filterlist          Lists all current filters enabled on the server.
                    (Alias: banlist)

filterload          Loads filter/ban list specified in the
                    filter_file and player_file server variables.
                    (Aliases: playernames, banload)

ban <player_id>     Bans a player from the server.
