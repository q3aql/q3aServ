
Challenge ProMode Arena: Client HUD Settings
--------------------------------------------

Date: 22-Apr-2009

This is a snapshot of http://www.promode.org/wiki/index.php/Custom_HUDs
The wiki will almost certainly be more up to date than this document.

Since the release of CPMA 1.34 we have had extremely configurable HUDs.
This document explains some of the Client HUD settings for CPMA.
It will never be as current as the changelog, so you should always
check that with each new release.

Note: cvars such as cg_drawfps, cg_drawtimer plus many others have been
removed and their functions moved to the custom hud.

Creating a HUD .cfg
-------------------
  * ALL hud configs go in Quake3/cpma/hud. CPMA's sample HUDs 1-7 are
    also in that directory.
  * You can select a config using \ch_file hud where 'hud' is the file
    you would like to use (without .cfg). You do NOT \exec hud.
  * Use \reloadHUD to reload your HUD if you have changed it. Must
    also be used after \ch_file change.
  * The default HUD is in the PK3: if you want to customise it, pull it
    out of there with the unzip utility of your choice, RENAME it, and
    put the copy in cpma/hud/. Remember to point ch_file at the new version.
  * The default HUD references (nearly) everything that can be drawn.
    Hud7 has nice examples of decoration use.


Syntax
------
    The syntax for CPMA's SuperHud is fairly easy to comprehend, and supports
    both multi-line and single-line arguments.

ELEMENT
{
    ELEMENT_COMMAND VALUE
    ELEMENT_COMMAND VALUE
}

ELEMENT { ELEMENT_COMMAND VALUE; ELEMENT_COMMAND VALUE; }

    You can comment using #. // cannot be used.
    Some Element Commands have optional "," separators.


Elements
--------
    Each piece of the HUD is called an ELEMENT. Elements are sorted
    z-layer-wise alphabetically.

!DEFAULT
    The first element in the hudfile MUST be "!DEFAULT", and every other
    element inherits from that default: this gives you an easy way to change
    fonts/colors/etc for a whole bunch of elements at once. !DEFAULT can be
    reused later in the document affecting every following element but it
    will not overwrite the parameters set by previous !DEFAULT(s). It is
    advisable to place Team1-8 and Chat1-8 at the bottom of your hud config
    so that !DEFAULTs can be used without interfering with other elements.

PreDecorate and PostDecorate
    Empty elements that can be used to draw separator bars etc. Limit 64 total.

AmmoMessage
    Low ammo/Out of ammo. The audio feedback "click" can be toggled using

WarmupInfo
    10sec countdown, Waiting for players, etc. Cannot be omitted. To hide
    place at off-screen x,y coordinates or set alpha 0.

WeaponList
    The WeaponList has to get a little funky to be able to handle all the
    legacyhud tricks: W and H are the size of EACH weapon, not the total.
    For the horizontal weaponlist (textalign C) X is the point to center
    around.
    Use FILL to show ammo for weapons you do not have, useful for TDM.
    Weaponlist wraps at the bottom of the screen so you can sneak a
    multi-column one in.



Colors
------
    CPMA HUD uses r g b a, which is red green blue alpha. Each channel can have
    values from 0-1.

    Color 1 1 1 1 is white, full alpha
    Color 0 0 0 0.5 is black, half transparent
    Color 0.25 0.25 1 0.75 is blue, somewhat transparent

    Note that colors set in SuperHud do not override colors set elsewhere. For
    example if your \nick or \name is ^3hello it will be yellow regardless.



Special Colors
--------------
    Color T and color E for elements to use red/blue according to your current
    team. Useful for flag modes, but not necessesary for tdm/1v1. Set
    bgcolor for these, even for images - see hud/old.cfg



Element Commands
----------------
    The commands you can use within an element are:

ANGLES <pitch> <yaw> <roll> [+pan | -rotate]
    Alters the display of MODEL.
    Note that most Q3 models do not work properly if r_vertexlight is on.

BGCOLOR r g b a
    Sets the background color for the element
    The element must have a width and height

COLOR r g b a
    Sets the foreground color for the element

DOUBLEBAR
    Makes bars two lines. Obviously only works on BAR elements
    (StatusBar_ArmorBar etc). Check out hud7 for examples.
    Note: Gets a little funky if RECT Height is set below 6 as the space
    between the two bars is 4 pixels and each bar requires 1 pixel
    (4+1+1=6)

FADE r g b a
    If the element has a TIME, its text will fade from COLOR to this
    linearly over TIME millisecons.

FILL
    If the element has a background color, this fills the area it
    occupies with that color.
    The element must have a width and height

FONT name
    Selects one of three standard fonts:
 CPMA - Bitstream Vera Bold, which is a high-resolution font best suited
    to 1024x768 and up - or large font-size on low-resolution
 ID - which is the standard Q3 font - good for small font-size and/or
    low-resolution
 IDBLOCK - only supports numbers, NOT letters
 THREEWAVE - which is an outlined copy of the id font
 SANSMAN - Digital Graphics Labs "Enter Sansman"

FONTSIZE pointsize | xsize ysize
    The CPMA font is correctly aspect-adjusted already, and generally looks
    best if you just specify a pointsize.
    The other two fonts are square, and generally look much better if you
    specify distinct x and y sizes, with y being 25-50% larger than x.
    Element texts can be mirrored using negative x y. Note this is an
    unintended and unsupported "hack", so might be a bit buggy.

IMAGE pathname
    Display the image specified. You can use ANY image or shader found in
    pk3s. Mostly useful for displaying team/enemy model icons in CA/CTFS/FT.

MODEL
    Can be any model in the game.
    Note that most Q3 models do not work properly if r_vertexlight is on.

MONOSPACE
    By default, all HUD fonts are proportionally spaced, meaning that an
    "i" takes up less room than an "m". Monospacing forces every character
    to take up the same amount of space. It's very useful for the team
    overlay, as it keeps everyone's health and armor in the same columns,
    but generally looks worse than proportional spacing on everything else,
    especially chat. It also takes up more room overall.

OFFSET x y z
    Offset MODEL along x y z axis.

RECT x y w h
    Sets the position and size of the element. Note that text is NOT
    "clipped" to this rectangle.
    Elements can be mirrored using negative w h. Note this is an
    unintended and unsupported "hack", so might be a bit buggy.

TEXT string
    Mostly useful for decorations. Requires RECT.

TEXTALIGN l | c | r
    Justify the text either Left, Centered, or Right within RECT

TEXTSTYLE flags
    Currently, only one flag is supported: "1", for dropshadowed text

TIME
    How long the element will be displayed for if it doesn't update again.
    Generally used for item pickups, frag messages, chat, etc.


HUD Related Cvars
-----------------
    These cvars do not directly influence the SuperHud but are still related
    to the HUD in some way.

cg_customLoc <0|1> (default = 1)
    Use custom locations for a map if possible.
    Loc files are locs/map.cfg, and must have a "v2" header
    Can only replace existing locations

cg_drawRewards <0|1> (default = 1)
    Toggle display of reward icons and the accompanying sounds

cg_teamChatsOnly <0|1> (default = 0)
    controls what text reaches the HUD Chat elements if set, non-team
    text still shows up in the console area

ch_3waveFont <0|1> (default = 1)
    Toggle use of the Threewave font (does not affect SuperHud settings)

ch_drawWarmup (<0|1> (default = 0)
    Toggle display of arena settings before a game starts

ch_drawWeaponSelect <0|1> (default = 0)
    Toggle id standard weapon selection

ch_recordMessage <0|1> (default = 1)

    Must be set before demo record start

ch_selfOnTeamOverlay <0|1> (default = 1)
    Toggle your own information showing in the team overlay

ch_shortNames <0|1> (default = 0)
    Toggle use of \nick - set a short name to use for team chat/overlay
    Limited to 5 visible characters, but allows colors
    Useful to have your \nick shown instead of [longclantag] in
    team chat/overlay
    Note: \nick is only used for team chat/overlay. \name is still
    used for anything else.

ch_wstatsTime <seconds> (default = 10)
    How long the auto-wstats window stays up at the end of a game

con_notifyTime <seconds> (default = 3)
    -1 uses the CPMA "Console" hud element instead of id's.
    Doesn't affect the console *buffer*, just the text in the top left.

mvw_DM (default "464 48 160 120")
    x, y, width, height of Picture in Picture window for DM games.

mvw_TDM<1-9>
    Controls teamplay Multi View layout.
    Format is the same as mvw_DM, default no child windows. Example:

    seta mvw_TDM1 "480 65 160 120"
    seta mvw_TDM2 "480 190 160 120"
    seta mvw_TDM3 "480 315 160 120"


Crosshair Cvars
---------------
cg_crosshairHealth <0|1> (default = 0)
    Red crosshair when low on health - must be 0 or ch_crosshairColor
    will not work

cg_crosshairsize <value> (default = 24)
    Size of crosshair

cg_drawcrosshair <0-9> (default = 8)
    Switch between different crosshairs

ch_crosshairAlpha <0.0 to 1.0> (default = 0.8)
    Controls the transparency of the crosshair

cg_drawCrosshairNames 0-2 (default = 1)
    Toggles TargetName and TargetStatus.
  0 - Off
  1 - On
  2 - Off in 1v1

ch_crosshairColor <color> (default = y)

    turn it off to use colored crosshairs

ch_crosshairPulse <0|1> (default = 0)
    Controls crosshair size changes when picking up items

ch_crosshairText <string> (default = "" disabled)
    Use any text string as crosshair


Known Issues
------------

    Limitation: Color fails on elements with color codes embedded in their
    strings (StatusBar_HealthCount, StatusBar_ArmorCount, NetGraphPing, etc)

    Limitation: Alpha fails on some elements containing images
    (StatusBar_AmmoIcon, StatusBar_ArmorIcon, etc)

    Limitation: Fade fails on some elements containing images without alpha
    channels (ItemPickupIcon etc)

    Limitation: If a !DEFAULT sets MONOSPACE, FILL or DOUBLEBAR there is no
    method to remove it again (so don't do it, unless it's at the end of the
    document)

    Limitation: Color T and E act funny when in non-teamplay modes such as
    1v1 (like the #ch_teamBackground hack)

    Limitation: FILL plus bgcolor when used on elements that disappear
    without having TIME makes bgcolor remain indefinately

    Not implemented: cg_drawRewards element not included in SuperHud
