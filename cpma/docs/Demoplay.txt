
Challenge ProMode Arena: Demo Playing
-------------------------------------
Date: 25 Jun 03

This document explains some of the Demo Playback features of CPMA.
It will never be as current as the changelog, so you should always
check that with each new release.


Key Operations
==============
Keystrokes and mouse clicks no longer abort demos.  If you have binds
that you wish to use, press ESC once.  However there are a standard
set of keys for most common demo functions:

 .:Standard Demo
	TAB brings up the scoreboard
	PGUP / PGDN adjusts playback speed by +-0.25
	HOME sets playback speed to 1.0
	KP_5 toggles third-person rendering
	KP_UPARROW / KP_DNARROW moves camera to / from player
	KP_LEFT / KP_RIGHT moves camera around player
	KP_HOME resets camera distance and angle
	F11 takes a screenshot

 .:MultiViewDemo only
	SPACE/MOUSE2 switches to next player
	ALT switches to previous player
	MOUSE1 in a coachview zooms in to that player
	MOUSE1 in a main view switches to coachview
	MOUSE1 on a subview switches to that player
	B - Blue Flag, i.e. *red* FC (CTF duh!)
	R - Red Flag, i.e. *blue* FC
	F - either FC
	I - Invis player
	Q - Quad player
	S - Batsuit player
	P - any player with a real PU (i.e. not Regen/Flight/Speed)
	for F and P, if there's more than one PU/flag in play
	each keypress will cycle to the next one

Note that cg_followpowerup and team overlay work during MVD playback


Demo Browser
============
CPMA supports directory trees of demos.  Hitting ESC in a demo menu 
tree pops you up one level rather than straight back to the main menu 
- that annoys me. "Back" still jumps all the way out just in case you 
like it.  Once you find the demo you desire, you can hit ENTER to
launch it or select Play.
