
Challenge ProMode Arena: Server Settings
----------------------------------------
Date: 11 Jun 08


Recommended dedicated server command-line:

    quake3 +set dedicated 2 +set fs_game cpma +set vm_game 2 +exec <config>


mode_start <string>
	Specify the game type to start the server with.
	* 1v1  - Duel / "Classic" Deathmatch
	  FFA  - Free For All
	  TDM  - Team Deathmatch
	  CTF  - Capture The Flag
	  CA   - Clan Arena
	  FTAG - FreezeTag (European rules)
	  CTFS - Capture Strike
	Or a custom mode: see docs/Modes.txt for details.

mode_idletime <minutes>
	how long before idle servers reset to default mode+map (default: 10)

server_gameplay <CPM|PMC|CQ3|VQ3>
	Sets the level (speed and strategic depth) of gameplay to use.
	* CPM - Challenge ProMode II (Modern CPM, 2004+)
	  PMC - ProMode Classic (2000-2003)
	  CQ3 - Challenge Quake3
	  VQ3 - Vanilla Quake3 (OSP)

server_maxpacketsmin <value>
	Specifies minimum client cl_maxpackets setting (Default = 30,
	0 = no lower limit on client cl_maxpackets).

server_maxpacketsmax <value>
	Specifies maximum client cl_maxpackets setting (Default = 125,
	0 = no upper limit on client cl_maxpackets).

server_motdfile <filename>
	Defines an external file from which to read MOTD message to
	display to a client.  This file will override
	any server_motdX variable setting (defined below).
	(Default = "none" - No MOTD file defined).

server_motdX <string> (X = 1 through 8)
	Sets the server MOTD.  Each var is used to display a line in the
	MOTD.  The message is terminated when the first NULL ("") line is
	encountered.

server_optimiseBW <0|1>
	Force the optimiseBW algorithm on for all clients, which greatly
	reduces the amount of unnecessary data sent out.
	Regrettably, this also makes you unable to see players through
	portals, thanks to a bug in the Q3 engine. Regardless, this really
	should NEVER be set to 0 except when on LAN - the difference is
	just staggering.
	  0 - Waste huge amounts of bandwidth for no good reason.
	* 1 - Don't.  :)

server_timenudgemin <value>
	Specifies minimum client cl_timenudge setting (Default = 0,
	no lower limit on client cl_timenudge).

server_timenudgemax <value>
	Specifies maximum client cl_timenudge setting (Default = 0,
	no upper limit on client cl_timenudge).

server_ratemin <value>
	Specifies minimum client rate setting (Default = 0,
	no lower limit on client rate).

server_record <value>
	1 - record demos
	2 - take screenshots
	4 - add server name to demo/screenshot filenames
	8 - add server time when game starts to filenames

server_availmodes <string>
	Restrict the server to a subset of supported game types
	(Default: "" - all modes available)

server_chatfloodprotect <value>
	Controls max # of msgs per second (Default = 0)
	e.g. server_chatfloodprotect 2 means you can talk every 500ms	

ref_password <string>
	Sets the password for in-game "referee" (admin) access.
	Setting this password to "none" disables the referee feature
	(default = "none").


========================
   GENERAL Q3 OPTIONS
========================

g_inactivity <seconds>
	Specifies how long a player can idle before being kicked
	from the server.  A value of "0" disables this feature
	(default = 0).

g_log <logfilename>
	Specifies the name of the file to save all in-game
	information.  Setting this to "" disables logging
	(default = "games.log").
	It's worth pointing out that logfiles can get very large,
	and for public servers there's really not much point in
	using them. Anything truly important will be written to
	the admin log instead, which is a separate file.


==============================
   MATCH-RELATED PARAMETERS
==============================

match_mutespecs <0|1>
	Enables/disables spectator chat being displayed to active
	players in the game when a match is in progress (default = 0).

match_readypercent <percentage from 1-100>
	Specifies the percentage of in-game players who must be
	"ready" to start a match.  This can also be used to get
	a match going on an otherwise long "warmup" period
	(default = 51).

match_maxsuicides <value>
	players who /kill more than this many times will be auto-banned
	stops them screwing up TDM games and forcing draws in DA
	(default = 0).

match_WinDelayDA (in milliseconds, default 2000)
	controls how long after the kill a winner is actually declared
	so if you rail someone but then their rocket takes you out,
	the round is ruled a draw

match_winDelayCA (in milliseconds, default 4000)	
	same as match_WinDelayDA, but for Clan Arena games


==============
   TEAMPLAY
==============

team_allcaptain <0|1>
	  0 - Traditional captaincy assignments (1 per team).
	* 1 - All players on a team have the ability to invite
		spectators or to call a time-out.  There is still
		a single "true" captain.

g_teamAutoJoin <0|1>
	* 0 - Places connecting players in spectator mode once they
		have fully connected to the game.
	  1 - Automatically places a player on the team with the
		lowest number of players (or score if equal player
		counts) after fully connecting to the game.

g_teamForceBalance <0|1>
	* 0 - Allows players to join any team, regardless of player counts.
	  1 - Forces players to join the team that has fewer players

vote_percent <1-100>
	Specifies the percentage of accepting clients needed for a
	vote to pass. Note that a player who does not vote is assumed to
	be opposed to the change. This saves players being forced to break
	off actual play simply to "defend" against an unwanted vote.

vote_allow_<setting>
	All but a few votes have a corresponding vote_allow_<setting> cvar,
	which enables fine control of players' ability to call votes.
	Note that a referee may change ANY votable setting, regardless
	of its vote_allow control, so you should use vote_allow_referee 0
	as well if you choose to disable any votes.

	* 1 - Allows clients to vote on the item.

allcaptain <0|1>
